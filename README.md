# Shopping-List-Processing
The program uses two arrays, namely itemCode[] to hold the code number of items and itemPrice[] to hold the prices. A third data member count is used to keep a record of items in the list. The program uses a total of four functions to implement the operations to be performed on the list. The statement

const int m 100;

defines the size of the array members.

The first function CNT() simply sets the variable count to zero. The second function getitem() gets the item code and the item price interactively and assigns them to the array members itemCode(count) and itemPrice[count]. Note that inside this function count is incremented after the assignment operation is over The function displaySum() first evaluates the total value of the order and then prints the value. The fourth function remove() deletes a given item from the list It uses the dem code to locate it in the list and sets the price to zero indicating that the item is not active in the list. Lastly, the function displaystems) displays all the items in the list. 
The program implements all the tasks using a menu-based user interface
